# Financial Loan-Defaulter
The Goal is to predict if a customer will be a loan defaulter or not based on various attributes such as funded amount, term, interest rates, loan amount, balance

## DOMAIN: Finance and Banking

## CONTEXT:
There seems to be no end to bad loans. According to the Reserve Bank of India, the overall bad loans as
of March 2021 stood at INR 8.35 lakh crore, compared to INR 8.96 lakh crore in March 2020. Banks run into losses when a customer doesn't pay their loans on time. Because of this, every year, banks have losses
in crores, and this also impacts the country's economic growth to a large extend.
In This is project, I look at various attributes such as funded amount, term, interest rates, loan amount, balance, etc. to predict if a customer will be a loan defaulter or not.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
The Goal is to predict if a customer will be a loan defaulter or not based on the given input
features such as funded amount, term, interest rate etc.

## Approach to Model building:
Designing a data driven decision product typically traces the following process:
### 1. Data and insights:
Warehouse the relevant data. Clean and validate the data as per the the functional requirements of the problem statement. Capture and validate all possible insights from the data as per the the functional requirements of the problem statement. Please
remember there will be numerous ways to achieve this. Sticking to relevance is of utmost importance. Pre-process the data which
can be used for relevant Machine learning model.
### 2. ML training:
Use the data to train and test a relevant ML model. Different ML models react differently and perform depending on quality of the
data. Baseline your best performing model and store the learnings for future usage.
